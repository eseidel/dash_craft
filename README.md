# dash_craft
 Just playing around.


# Todo
* Each location should be an location object rather than an ItemStack.  Drags just connect two locations rather than moving items.
* Make it possible to save current state.
* Add icons for items
* Show recipe being crafted (if known?)
* Make it possible to not-know recipes?
* Make it possible to drag a whole stack for crafting?


Bugs
* Crafting always works, even when missing things.
* When multi-crafting, can you get multi-goop?
* How is percent success effected by multi-crafting?

* Missing Features
* Learning recipes
* Recipe book
